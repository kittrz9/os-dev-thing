# things I need to do
 - switch to ext2
 - figure out how to mount the disk image without root permissions
 - implement ATA writing and write to the filesystem
 - implement more syscalls
 - improve shell (add the ability to pass args and stuff like that)
 - add more programs (maybe a port of ed and a simple assembler)
 - load elf files in a non-hardcoded way
 - maybe not run everything in kernel mode
 - multitasking
 - get ld.lld in the llvm toolchain working
 - get it working with the `-nostdinc` compile flag
 - figure out what I'm going to actually do with the kernel (monolithic vs microkernel and stuff like that)

<hr>

# things that I don't really need to do but want to do eventually
 - UEFI booting
 - make the kernel and bootloader compatible with multiboot
