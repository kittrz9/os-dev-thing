# things I need to do
 - implement parts of the c standard library like memcpy
 - figure out memory management stuff
 - get a better fix to the weird framebuffer collision issue mentioned in `src/stage2/screen.c`
 - figure out what I'm going to actually do with the kernel part if I ever actually get to that

<hr>

# things that I don't really need to do but want to do eventually
 - get audio output
	- maybe just pc beeper, though ideally would want something with PCM
	- maybe AC97
 - UEFI booting
