# things I need to do
 - implement the rest of string.h
 - figure out memory management stuff
 - figure out paging stuff
 - make a page frame allocator (<https://wiki.osdev.org/Page_Frame_Allocation>)
 - read from the file system and load the kernel from that
 - move keyboard and terminal stuff into the kernel instead of stage2 once I actually start working on that
 - move files that will be used in the kernel and stage2 into their own directory
 - implement ATA writing
 - figure out what I'm going to actually do with the kernel part if I ever actually get to that

	- maybe just pc beeper, though ideally would want something with PCM
