# things I need to do
 - implement the rest of string.h
 - figure out memory management stuff
 - figure out paging stuff
 - make a page frame allocator (<https://wiki.osdev.org/Page_Frame_Allocation>)
 - figure out how to compile programs to be ran in the os
 - load kernel as an elf file rather than just raw bytes
 - make the kernel compatible with other bootloaders
 - implement ATA writing and write to the filesystem
 - figure out what I'm going to actually do with the kernel (monolithic vs microkernel and stuff like that)

<hr>

# things that I don't really need to do but want to do eventually
 - get audio output
	- maybe just pc beeper, though ideally would want something with PCM
